## The Nature Ninjas present:

The well-being of all life on our planet is under increasing pressure from climate change.

It has been known for decades that part of the solution lies in repairing our natural environment through tree planting and restoring forest to areas that have been cleared.

The **What grows here?** app will empower you to and be part of the solution and help you plant the right tree, at the right time in the right place.

Our companion learning hub will give passionate gardeners, educators, students and learners of all ages:

* access to additional information about plants
* teaching and learning resources
* the ability to share reflections, thoughts and your own content with others will be available in future updates of the learning hub
